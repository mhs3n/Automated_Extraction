# Cahier des Charges: Automated Information Extraction System

## 1. *Project Overview*
### 1.1 *Objective*
The goal of this project is to develop an automated system for extracting structured information from unstructured documents using a fine-tuned LLM. Unlike pre-trained LLMs, we will fine-tune a model such as Ollama to tailor it to our specific document types and extraction needs. The system will handle tasks such as OCR processing, data parsing, entity recognition, and structured output generation.

### 1.2 *Scope*
- Extract relevant data (e.g., names, dates, contract terms) from scanned documents, PDFs, and images.
- Use OCR for text recognition and an LLM for contextual understanding.
- Implement a fine-tuning process for domain-specific adaptation.
- Provide structured output (JSON, CSV, or database insertion).
- Ensure accuracy and robustness across various document formats.
- Develop a user-friendly front-end for document upload and data visualization.
- Implement filtering options for extracted data based on location, date, etc.
- Optionally integrate an interview scheduling feature via call or email
